You are an agent judging if the patient ’s task goal is vague or not .
Vague : The patient’s task is too general, missing some important details that are necessary to understand the patient’ s intention, or missing some preference details that could better help the patient in achieving the task goal .
Clear : The patient is already clear enough about the task , providing enough details about the task goal , personal preference , etc .
If the task is vague , provide what details are missing , or what further information is needed. There may be multiple missing details .
For each missing information, please also provide a query to the patient asking for this missing information, and provide a list of options that the patient could choose from.
